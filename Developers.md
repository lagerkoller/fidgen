# Developer information #

The tool has been built with [Processing](http://processing.org) (v0135, but other recent versions should be fine too) and furthermore requires the following libraries:

  * [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com):
    * [toxiclibscore-0014.zip](http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com/files/toxiclibscore-0014.zip) (or newer) subpackage
    * [verletphysics-0004](http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com/files/verletphysics-0004.zip) (or newer) subpackage
  * [ControlP5 0.2.11](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) (or newer) GUI library

The code should be straight forward, but isn't very well documented at the moment... am working on this.
